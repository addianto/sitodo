# Developing Sitodo From Zero

> A training course for developing a simple todo list Web application using Java
> and Spring Boot framework.

## Description

This is a training course for teaching students on how to develop a Web application
using Java programming language and Spring Boot framework, with focus on applying
test-first approach and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

-  Apply a workflow when using a version control system such as [Git][]
-  Develop a simple Web application using Java programming language and Spring
   Boot framework backed by a relational database.
-  Create tests for verifying the Web application in different levels, such as
   unit test, integration test, and functional test
-  Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using
   GitHub Actions (or similar platform such as GitLab CI/CD)

## Target Audience

While the course is designed for fresh graduates with a background in computing,
students coming from a different background can read and attend the course. At
minimum, you need to:

-  Have some experiences in programming, preferably using an object-oriented
   language
-  Understand relational data modeling and SQL operations
-  Know Web design and familiar with the related technologies such as HTML,
   basic JavaScript, and CSS
-  Know basic Linux shell scripting (e.g. `bash`) or its equivalent on Windows
   (e.g. `cmd` or `pwsh`)

## Requirements

To complete this course, you need a computing device that can run the following
development tools:

-  A shell, such as `bash` on Linux or macOS, or `cmd`/`pwsh` on Windows
-  Latest long-term support (LTS) version of Java Development Kit (JDK)
   -  Download JDK from [Adoptium][]
   -  At the time of writing, the latest LTS version is **17**
-  [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition by JetBrains][]
   -  While you can use other text editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code) or IDE such
      as Eclipse or NetBeans, we might not be able to troubleshoot any problems
      that come up during the course
-  [PostgreSQL][] database system version 14

In addition, you also need to have an account on the following online services:

-  [GitHub][] an online source code repository and project management system
-  [Heroku][] a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying the Web application
   - Install the CLI tool as well into your local development environment
