Description This is a training course for teaching students on how to develop a Web application using Java programming language and Spring Boot framework, with focus on applying test-first approach and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, students should be able to: Apply a workflow when using a version control system such as Git Develop a simple Web application using Java programming language and Spring Boot framework backed by a relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL) for data persistence Create tests for verifying the Web application in different levels, such as unit test, integration test, and functional test Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions (or similar platform such as GitLab CI/CD) Target Audience While the course is designed for fresh graduates with a background in computing, students coming from a different background can read and attend the course. At minimum, you need to: Have some experiences in programming, preferably using an object-oriented language Understand relational data modeling and SQL operations Know Web design and familiar with the related technologies such as HTML, basic JavaScript, and CSS Know basic Linux shell scripting (e.g. bash ) or its equivalent on Windows (e.g. cmd or pwsh ) Requirements To complete this course, you need a computing device that can run the following development tools: A shell, such as bash on Linux or macOS, or cmd / pwsh on Windows Latest long-term support (LTS) version of Java Development Kit (JDK) Download JDK from Adoptium At the time of writing, the latest LTS version is 17 IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition by JetBrains While you can use other text editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code) or IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans, we might not be able to troubleshoot any problems that come up during the course PostgreSQL database system version 14 In addition, you also need to have an account on the following online services: GitHub an online source code repository and project management system Fly.io a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying the Web application Install flyctl command-line tool as well License The learning materials in this course are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 ( CC BY-SA 4.0 ).
